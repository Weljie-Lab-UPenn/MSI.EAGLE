# MSI.EAGLE

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of MSI.EAGLE is to create an interactive user app for processing of mass spec imaging data. It uses many of the processing features from Cardinal, and adds a number of analysis options.

## Installation

You can install the development version of MSI.EAGLE as follows:

``` r
<!-- # FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE? -->
Install using: 

Step 1*: Install Bioconductor packages

install.packages("remotes")

if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install(c("BiocParallel", "Cardinal"))

One can also install the CardinalWorkflows package for demo data
BiocManager::install("CardinalWorkflows")
```

```
Step 2: Install Git
```
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
```

Step 3: Install MSI.EAGLE

remotes::install_git("https://github.com/Weljie-Lab-UPenn/MSI.EAGLE")
```

```

```

```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to setup and start the app:

```{r example}
# basic startup script

# set up the directory with raw data
 rawd = ('path/to/rawfilesdirectory')

# set up the working directory
wd = ('path/to/workingdirectory') # wd = rawd

# ncores = as.integer(parallel::detectCores()/2) # use 1/2 of the available processors
 ncores = as.integer(parallel::detectCores())-2 # us all but 2 available processors
 library(MSI.EAGLE)
 #MSI.EAGLE() # uncomment to start the app

```


## Access as a private repository (TEMP)

3. Store the PAT in .Renviron (Recommended)

A more secure way is to store the PAT in your .Renviron file, which is loaded into your environment when you start R. This way, you don't have to expose the PAT in your scripts.

    Edit .Renviron:
        You can edit or create a .Renviron file in your home directory or the project directory:

        r

usethis::edit_r_environ()

Add the following line to the file:

makefile

        GITHUB_PAT=your_personal_access_token

    Restart R to load the new environment variable.

    Install the Package:
        Now you can simply use remotes::install_github("username/repo_name") without needing to pass the PAT each time.

This approach keeps your PAT secure while still allowing you to install packages from private repositories.


<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
